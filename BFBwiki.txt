Battle for BFB and Battle for BFDI (BFB) are two segments that make up the fourth season of the Battle for Dream Island series and the successor to the third season IDFB. It premiered on November 3, 2017, with the release of "Getting Teardrop to Talk." and concluded on April 9, 2021, with the release of "Chapter Complete".

A fifth season, known as Battle for Dream Island: The Power of Two, aired simultaneously. It was announced to premiere on January 9, 2021, but due to bugs with the intro[citation needed], it premiered on January 10, 2021. A sixth season is also planned to be made after BFB ends.

The prize used to be a BFDI, but in "The Escape from Four", Four upgraded it to a BFB to keep contestants competing. In "X Marks the Spot", he added the original prize (a BFDI) back to the prize pool, making BFB the first season to have two prizes.
